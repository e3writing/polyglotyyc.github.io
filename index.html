    <h1>Vision</h1>
    <p>Polyglot: knowing or using several languages. This event is inspired from https://www.polyglotconf.com/ in Vancouver. We hope gather 80 Calgary software developers who will leave language, platform and possibly even editor wars behind and come together for a spontaneously organized day of amazing talks, round-table discussions, panel sessions and coding.</p>

    <p>If you've never been to an un-conference (or open-space) event before your owe it to yourself to make it to Polyglot Calgary 2018. It's an experience like no other.</p>

    <h1>Who are we?</h1>
    <p>Polyglot Calgary isn't the product of some faceless corporation looking to make a buck by getting you to a conference and then selling you a time-share. The organizers are all community members from around Calgary: just like you! We saw a lot of user groups for Ruby, Python, functional languages, .net, etc. but very few places where developers from different communities could get together. We hope that Polyglot will be that place: a place for technologists to get together and talk about the craft.</p>

    <h1>Talks</h1>
    <p>
      Open-space un-conferences are spontaneously scheduled and 100% attendee driven. Sessions will be proposed, selected and organized at the opening the conference. We also encourage attendees to suggest and discuss ideas in advance.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Looking for ideas? Check out these different unconference session types: <a href="http://www.environmentalevaluators.net/ideas-for-designing-and-leading-sessions">http://www.environmentalevaluators.net/ideas-for-designing-and-leading-sessions</a>
    </p>

    <p>
      Talks can be on any topic that is even vaguely related to technology. It can be on a hard technical topic or on a soft topic like "Having Empathy". They should be between 30 and 45 minutes long. We'll have projectors and a bunch of adaptors, just bring a laptop if you want use them.
